## WORKDIR

```WORKDIR``` command is used to define the working directory of a Docker container at any given time.

Any command(RUN,CMD,ADD,COPY etc) will be executed in the specified working directory.

``` dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:16.04
WORKDIR /project
RUN npm install
```

If the ```project``` directory does not exist, it will be created. The ```RUN``` command will be executed inside project.
