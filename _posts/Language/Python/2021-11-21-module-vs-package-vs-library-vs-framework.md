Module is a file which contains various Python functions and global variables. It is simply just .py extension file which has python executable code.

Package is a collection of modules. It must contains an __init__.py file as a flag so that the python interpreter processes it as such. The __init__.py could be an empty file without causing issues.

Library is a collection of packages.

Framework is a collection of libraries. This is the architecture of the program.

Application is an application. Yah, Iâ€™m sure about this one.
